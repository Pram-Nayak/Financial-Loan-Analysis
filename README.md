# **Financial Loan Analysis - Power BI Project**  

Welcome to the **Financial Loan Analysis** Power BI project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing bank loan data to uncover valuable insights that support data-driven decision-making.  

## **Overview**  
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of bank loans, covering key performance indicators (KPIs), regional trends, borrower profiles, and loan performance. The project consists of three main dashboards: **Summary, Overview, and Details**.  

## **Dashboard 1: Summary**  
### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
- **Total Loan Applications:** Tracks the total number of loan applications over a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.  
- **Total Funded Amount:** Measures the total disbursed loan amount, with MTD and MoM comparisons.  
- **Total Amount Received:** Monitors borrower repayments to assess cash flow and loan repayment trends.  
- **Average Interest Rate:** Calculates the overall average interest rate across all loans, including MTD and MoM variations.  
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluates the financial health of borrowers based on their DTI, tracking both MTD and MoM fluctuations.  

### **Summary Visualization:**  
- **Loan Status Grid View:** Provides an overview of lending operations, categorizing loans by their status while displaying essential KPIs like total applications, total funded amount, total amount received, MTD/MoM changes, interest rates, and DTI.  

## **Dashboard 2: Overview**  
- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Identifies seasonal patterns and long-term lending trends.  
- **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Highlights geographical distribution of loan activities and regional disparities.  
- **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Visualizes the distribution of loans across different term lengths.  
- **Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Assesses loan distributions based on borrower employment duration.  
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Provides a visual representation of loans categorized by purpose.  
- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Displays how home ownership status influences loan applications and disbursements.  

## **Dashboard 3: Details**  
### **Objective:**  
The **Details Dashboard** delivers a granular view of loan metrics, borrower profiles, and payment performance to support informed decision-making.  

### **Dataset Overview:**  
The dataset includes key fields such as:  
- **Loan ID, Address State, Loan Purpose, Grade, Sub Grade, Annual Income, Loan Status, Last Payment Date, Verification Status, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Interest Rate**, and more.  
These attributes help analyze borrower demographics, financial stability, loan characteristics, risk assessment, and repayment behavior.
